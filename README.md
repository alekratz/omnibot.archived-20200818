# omnibot

Omnibot is an IRC chatbot framework. It is designed for:

* Ease of module and command creation.
* Uptime: module code and configuration can be reloaded on demand.

This project is presently in development. Please report bugs through the
[Github issues](https://github.com/alekratz/omnibot/issues) page as you encounter them.
